# accept-cookies-exercise

I recently completed a closed book exam on Vue principles and failed the dev exam which consisted with handling a cookie accept / decline message. The thing I got stuck on was the global key press monitoring. I totally forgot about event listeners and was not able to do a quick google search. This is a rebuild of that exam section so I could refresh my memory and prepare for a resit of the exam.
